"""A dropped connection must not stay alive in the atexit registry.

Every ``_create_connection`` registers a cleanup that closes over the
ServiceInstance, and ``atexit`` holds that closure -- and so the SI -- until the
process exits. Nothing unregistered it, so a long-running MCP server that
reconnects after each session expiry (踩坑 #40) accumulated one dead
ServiceInstance per reconnect, and at exit would run a Disconnect against every
session it had ever opened. The id(si) side stores were correctly down to one
entry the whole time -- the side-store discipline was never the leak.

Reachability is the assertion, not ``atexit._ncallbacks()``. That counter does
not decrease on unregister: a subprocess check shows an unregistered handler is
genuinely never called while ``_ncallbacks()`` still reports it. Asserting on it
would have measured nothing in either direction.

Only ``SmartConnect`` is patched, so the production registration runs. A test
that registered its own handler would pass with the production one deleted.
