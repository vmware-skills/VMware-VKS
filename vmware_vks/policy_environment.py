"""Tell vmware-policy which environment a target belongs to, on every surface.

Environment-scoped policy rules ("freeze-production-writes") need this skill's
own config to know which environment a target is in; vmware-policy cannot read
it. The lookup used to be registered in mcp_server/server.py, which the CLI
never imports, so @guarded CLI writes -- which go through the same guard() --
could never match an environment rule (verified 2026-09-11: after importing
only the CLI, no resolver was registered). Importing this module registers the
lookup; the MCP server and the CLI entry point both import it.
